# Literature Review Proposal

## Topic
Implementation of Multi-Sensor Fusion with Unified Bird’s-Eye View Representation for Autonomous Navigation in TurtleBot Mobile Robots, Based on LiDAR-Camera Fusion

## Background
TurtleBot, an open-source mobile robot platform, is widely used in educational and research settings for robotics and autonomous system studies. Implementing a multi-sensor fusion mechanism that utilizes both LiDAR and camera data is critical for enhancing the robot's environmental perception and navigation capabilities. A unified Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the surroundings, leading to improved decision-making and autonomy in navigation tasks.

## Objectives
- To study and implement effective methods for fusing LiDAR and camera data in TurtleBot robots.
- To develop a unified BEV representation that integrates data from multiple sensors for real-time navigation.
- To evaluate the impact of sensor fusion on obstacle avoidance, path planning, and environmental mapping.

## Research Questions
- How can the TurtleBot platform be leveraged to perform advanced sensor fusion between LiDAR and camera inputs?
- What are the benefits of using a unified BEV representation for the TurtleBot's autonomous navigation and how can it be implemented?
- What challenges arise when adapting existing sensor fusion algorithms to a small-scale mobile robot platform like TurtleBot?
